 <p>-But in this case we will just talk about football,a personal favorite to be honest.
    <br/>
   - Simply,Football is a very popular sport that is played at high schools, colleges, and professional stadiums. It involves running, passing, kicking, and body contact. 

   <br/>

   - A football game is played between two teams of 11 players each. A team scores points by moving a ball across the other team's goal line.
